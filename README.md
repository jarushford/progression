# Progression

### Abstract 

This was an app that I built to aid climbers in the mental training and motivation that is required for high-level competition and projecting. Climbing has always been a large part of my life and there have been many times when being busy with other parts of life has made it hard to motivate and stay focused with training and projecting. So, I wanted to make an app to try to help with this. This app is 99+ % tested using Jest/Enzyme and has a custom built weekly calendar. Tech stack includes React, Redux, React Router, Sass, and Redux Thunk Middleware which interacts with an Express and Postgres backend.
